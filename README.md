# 📦 Docker, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes Course
This repository contains the files and projects I developed as a student during a Docker course, which also covered Docker Swarm and Kubernetes topics.

Docker: container creation and management

Docker Compose: orchestration of multiple containers

Docker Swarm: clustering and service replication

Kubernetes: deployment, scaling, and management of applications in clusters

### 🛠️ What You Will Find Here

Scripts and examples of deployment with Swarm

Basic Kubernetes orchestration configurations

Exercises and mini projects developed during the course

### 🚀 Technologies Used
