📦 Docker, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes Course
This repository contains the files and projects I developed as a student during a Docker course, which also covered Docker Swarm and Kubernetes topics.

Docker Swarm: clustering and service replication

Kubernetes: deployment, scaling, and management of applications in clusters
